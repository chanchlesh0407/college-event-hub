            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The club is the technical club of SGSITS which was started in November 2017. The club was made by IT students who felt the need to have a practical approach to the technical aspects of engineering. Since its inception, the club has become a city-wide sensation and has been successfully hosting various contests and sessions. This technical community includes around 30 members from three batches. The motive of the club is to create a student learning community, which will coordinate and help each other gain technical knowledge. We aim to provide learning opportunities by collaborating with technical companies and institutions. We have a vision that every student graduating from SGSITS and belonging to the community should be technically skilled and have gained the soft skills necessary for every future endeavor.
