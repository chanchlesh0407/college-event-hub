                        <p>Robocalaypse event was just the end of a phase of Learning robotics and IOT, with an assurance of many more to follow. The classroom was filled with positive learning environment on both the days incorporating participation from both, mentors as well as students, through an action-based approach. The teaching and enlightenment from Robotronix team was amazing and included constant and creative opportunities for practice and innovation.
                            It was an amazing experience for us. Hope you had just as much fun attending!
