            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Art as we all know is a vital aspect of one’s personality and this quality once kindled can help students to realize their full potential and even utilize it. KSHITIJ, the cultural club of SGSITS, Indore, established on 7th February, 2015 aims at fulfilling this goal. Since its beginning, it has been a platform that promotes cultural values amongst the students of our institute through various channels. Through this club, we elevate and invoke the cultural and musical trends as well as the talents of youth. Looking beyond academics, we see the mettle of our college flourished in the expressive flamboyance. Counting our achievements backwards, we organised an amazing flash mob in the month of March 2015. The team of dancers comprised majorly of members of the club. We managed to reach out to a wide and enthusiastic audience through it, in another attempt to keep the flair of art of dancing alive. The event was huge success. The club also contributed by organising band performances in various events organised by other clubs of the college. The club conducted recruitment drives for different departments encompassing dance, drama and music. It received an overwhelming response from the enthusiastic students. A team of responsible and dedicated students was thus formed and the club is ever evolving and ever growing to achieve the zenith of perfection. The members of KSHITIJ are loyal and devoted towards their responsibilities and are willing to give their all to make this club shine brighter than sun. The students in this group are encouraged to flourish themselves in an unruffled manner and learn the arts in merriment. The kith and kin of KSHITIJ are inclined towards carrying forward the tradition and culture of the club for years to come. We strongly believe in the maxim- “Fight gravity and fly away. Reach new horizons and expand yourself”. Club Kshitij Annual Report 2019-20</p>
