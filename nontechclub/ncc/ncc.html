            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization, comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the ‘University Corps’, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the object to make up the shortage of the Army. In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the ‘University Corps’ was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth.The UTC Officers and cadets dressed like the army. It was a significant step towards the Indianisation of armed forces.</p>

                        <p>The motto of NCC is “Unity and Discipline”. ‘Unity’ implies our basic oneness, the brotherhood of all the Indian people regardless of their caste, colour or creed. Likewise, ‘Discipline’ is the very bedrock on which any nation is founded. It is for these reasons that “Unity and Discipline” has been adopted as motto of the NCC. </p>
